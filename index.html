<p class="dashed">Head Coach:Cory Davies<br>
Cory Davies started off as head coach in the 2017 season. He has had a all time-record of 19-25 with the school and althoughit is a losing record, he still has some magic. Including a win over the previosly undefeated Toms River North back in 2018, to an undefeated streak against his old team: Howell, to upsetting Brick memorial this year. He has been the major playcaller and still manages to hold the team together even through any trials and tribulations.</p>
