 On September 30th, Freehold Twp. went on a away game to Brick Memorial. By half time, they were down by 14 by the half, yet by the end, they had scored 21 unanswered points as well as stop a 2-pt conversion by the end to put away the game. From Enlow's multiple runs leading to a 55 yard td to 3 yard  Cardone to Corchado td. With another rushing touchdown, the Patriots were not only back, but also managed to win after Brick did get a touchdown, but was stopped on for the two point conversion. This game kept the Patriots on .500 and kept their playoff chances alive. Because of this performance, this would give the team the "Jersey Mikeâ€™s Week 5 Shore Conference Football Team of the Week"
